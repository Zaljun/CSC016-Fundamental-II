Introduction to Linux

Step 1. Verify your account works.

You should already have an account open on Linux machines. The account
name is the same as your other accounts at Hofstra (e.g. on the PCs,
Novell network). The password should be set to your 700 number.

Change password: To change password type passwd command in a terminal
	window.

Open a terminal window: A terminal window is a program that accepts and
	runs Linux commands. To open a terminal window click on the right mouse
	button and select terminal window.

Step 2. Try file manager commands: pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, rmdir, rm, cp,
		mv.

Here is a list of frequent Unix commands that allow you to check, modify
the files/directories in your account. Check the effect of all these
Unix commands from the terminal window by typing their name at the
prompt sign. To find more information about a command you can use man
<command name> at the prompt. Browse the help of each of the following
Unix commands and make notes on what you found interesting.

1.  pwd 
		lists the path to the current directory and the name of the
		current directory

Path: is a list of directories separated by /. Indicates the "path" from
	the root directory to the current directory.

	After logging in, the current directory is your home directory and the
	path to it is: home/<your user name>.  Write that path down in the
	report.

Home directory is the root directory for your account. You have certain
privileges in the home directory: write/delete, create directories,
execute files, etc. This is the only directory where you have full
access. All the directories/files you create here inherits all the
privileges of the home directory. In home directory you will create new
directories to store your C++ program files, you will compile and
execute the java programs.

2.  ls 
		lists the files and directories in your current directory

	- to list all files and directories in the current directory type: 
				ls <Enter>

	- to list all files you have in a directory (including system files)
		type:  	ls -a <Enter>

	Note the difference between ls and ls -a.

	- to list all your files and directories plus information about: the
	file type (extension e.g. (.exe, .txt, etc.), the date created, the
	size, type: 
				ls -l <Enter> . 
	
	Note the difference between ls and ls -l.

	Identify at least 2 files and two directories in your home
	directory. What is the difference in information listed by ls -l 
	for a file or a directory? 

	- to search for specific files use: ls <file name>

	- in <file name> you can use * to substitute for any character, any
	number of characters.  <file name> can contain the name of a file with
	or without wild card characters (e.g. *) or a path.

	ex. Want to see the list of files with extension java: ls *.java

	ex. the list of executable files: ls *.exe

3.  cd 
		changes the current directory

	Ex.  cd <directory name>   
			changes the current directory to <directory name>. 
			If <directory name> contains the name of a directory then that
			directory must be a child (a part of) the current directory.

	- <directory name> can also be a path to another directory.

4.  mkdir 
		creates a new directory

	Ex. mkdir <directory name> 
		Creates a new directory with the name <directory name> in the 
		current directory.

5.  rmdir 
		deletes a directory if it is empty (there are no other files
		or directories in it)]

		Ex. rmdir <directory name>

6.  rm 
		deletes one or more files in the current directory

	Ex. rm <file name> 
		deletes the file with the name <file name>. In <file name> you can use 
		wild card characters (e.g. *) or a path followed
		by a file name. Be careful, you will not be able to recover the file(s)
		you delete using rm.

7.  cp 
	copies files from one directory to another

	Ex. cp <source file> <destination file> 
		Copies <source file> into <destionation file>.

		<destination file> can specify a directory. Then <source file> is copied
		into directory.

8.  mv 
	moves a file from one directory to another. It deletes the file
	from the source location

	Ex. mv <source file> <destination file> 
	 moves <source file> into <destination file>. If <destination file> indicates 
	 a directory it moves <source file> into the specified directory.

Special characters in a path name:

	~ Signals the path to your home directory. It is used at the beginning
	of a path name.

	Ex. cd ~ it takes you back from any directory to your home directory.

	Ex. cd ~/directory1/directory2/ - moves to directory2, which is a child
	of directory1, which is a child of your home directory.

	..  (Double dots) Signifies a node up in the directory tree. It is
	relative to the current directory not to the home directory.

	Ex.  If the path to current directory is: home/user/JAVA/CLASSES/

	cd ../../ - takes the prompt from the current directory two directories
	up the tree, to directory user.

	Executing pwd after this cd command it will show you: home/user/

	Ex. If you want to copy a file from directory user to directory classes
	and your current directory is JAVA:

	cp ../file1.java CLASSES/ - the result of this command is that the
	file1.java from home/user/ was copied (with the same name) in 
	home/user/JAVA/CLASSES/

	.  (Single dot) Specifies the current directory.

	Ex. If you want to copy a file from your home directory in the current
	directory use:

	cp ~/file1.java .  - The dot specifies the destination, which is your
	current directory.


Step 3. Print commands: lpr, lpq

9.  lpr [options] <file name> 
		prints the content of <file name> to a printer.

	To print in Adams 204 use the following options: lpr <file name>

10.  lpq [options] 
	checks the list of tasks currently executed by the printer. 
	(e.g. what tasks (files) have been sent and what is their
	status).

	For Adams 204 use: lpq

Step 4. Other useful commands: ps, kill, who

11.  ps
		shows the state of all processes that run on your computer.

12.  kill 
		process_id - kills a process.

13.  who 
		lists the name of the users connected to a machine.


For more information about any command type: 
	man <command name> 

Step 5.  Get used with emacs or xemacs - a text editor in Unix.

	Type at the command line: xemacs & or emacs&. It will open a window
	called xemacs. The & sign tells the system to run the process associated
	with xemacs in the background (i.e. it will not block your command
	window, otherwise you will not be able to issue other commands in the
	terminal window until you exit xemacs). Write down in your report the
	difference of calling xemacs without &. You will write/modify your C++
	programs using xemacs.

Some useful xemacs commands:

	CTRL-x CTRL-f - opens a file (also called buffer)
	CTRL-x CTRL-s - saves a file.
	CTRL-x CTRL-w - saves a file with a new name.
	CTRL-x k - closes a file (buffer).
	CTRL-x CTRL-c - closes xemacs (kills the process).
	CTRL-xb - switches to another buffer (file).
	CTRL-x2 - splits the window in two windows. (CTRL-x1 shows again only
	one window).	
	CTRL-a - moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line.
	CTRL-e - moves the cursor to the end of the current line.
	CTRL-space - marks the beginning of a selection (where the cursor is
	positioned)
	ESC-w - copies in clipboard the block of text from the beginnning of a
	selection (previous command) to the current position of the cursor.
	CTRL-w - cuts - does what the previous command does, but it also deletes
	the marked block.
	CTRL-y - pastes the text in the clipboard at the current position of the
	cursor.
	CTRL-k - deletes a line from the position of the cursor to the end of
	the line.

	For a more complete list of xemacs commands print the emacs reference
	card from the course web page.

Step 6: Ways to transfer files from your LINUX account to your home
computer.

	You can use ssh and sftp from your machine to a LINUX machine. On your
	Windows home computer you need to have these two programs installed.

	Download ssh from
	ftp://ftp.gmu.edu/support/SSHSecureShellClient-3.2.9.exe and install it.

	After that open a ssh secure file transfer client and click connect.
	Enter connection information: adams204xx.hofstra.edu (instead of xx use
	01, 02, up to 30) and your account name. The connection port should be
	5010. Then press enter. If everything went fine, you will be able to
	transfer files between your home computer and your Linux account and to
	compile and run files in your Linux account.
